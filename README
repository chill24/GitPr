Mumble for the iPhone and iPod touch
====================================

This is the source code of Mumble (a gaming-focused social
voice chat utility) for iPhone OS-based devices.

The desktop version of Mumble runs on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux
and various other Unix-like systems. Visit its website at:

 <http://mumble.info/>

Building it
===========

To build this you need the iPhoneOS 3.0 SDK from Apple and an
Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.5 or later.

Before starting your build, you will need to check out the re-
quired submodules:

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update

Once finished, make do the same in the MumbleKit submodule:

 $ cd MumbleKit
 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update

This will fetch known "working" snapshot of the required submodules
for MumbleKit. (CELT, Speex and Protocol Buffers for Objective C)

Once this is done, you should be able to open up the Xcode
project file for Mumble (Mumble.xcodeproj) in the root of
the source tree and hit Cmd-B to build!
